Soy ingeniero de software profesional desde hace más de doce años.

En 2014 dejé mi trabajo en una multinacional y creé [**MoureDev**](https://mouredev.com), el reflejo de mi sueño de crecer como profesional dentro de la industria del desarrollo de software.
Desde entonces me he dedicado a especializarme en el desarrollo de aplicaciones móviles, colaborando con empresas de diferentes partes del mundo, creando más de 100 Apps y fundando mi propia startup.

En 2018 regreso a mi ciudad natal en Galicia (España), y empiezo a crear contenido de programación y compartir mi experiencia como desarrollador en plataformas como YouTube, Twitch o Udemy. Me gustaría devolver de alguna manera todo el conocimiento que la comunidad ha compartido conmigo de forma gratuita a lo largo de los años.
